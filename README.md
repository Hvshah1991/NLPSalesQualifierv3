## App Overview

### Description

Pre-Qualifying leads with automation can be an asset for business development field. In last couple of months, I was able to dive into this topic and created a Python based - NLP Sales Qualifier for Finance Professionals ðŸ’µ.

Once leads are sourced you just need to pass their company website address through it and the pre-qualifier (interfaced on Streamlit) will scrape the information and utilised Naive Bayes ðŸ“ˆ model (embodied with Bag Of Words) to predict the Persona of the lead. The current model I made encompasses all the Personas of Finance Industry ðŸ’°. The output data is stored in SQL database ðŸ’¾ after every run and it can be downloaded as a csv file directly from the front-end.

Made the NLP Sales Qualifier ðŸ¤– utilising seaborn, beautifulsoup4, openai, pandas, numpy...many more. A complete machine learning based application that can automate lead pre-qualification process for you. It supports 4 languages currently: English, Spanish, Polish and German.
